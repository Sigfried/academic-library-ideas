Ideas for services and projects for the library of a large research university (because I'm in the student advisory group)

## General research services

 - better support for citation management software
 - support for open-source research authoring workflows
 - support for open-science, FAIR data management, curation, publishing
 - training and individual support should go beyond beginner-level use
   of tools
   - library should choose specific tools it recommends (preferably open-source;
     probably Zotero for citation mgt; LaTeX (and OpenOffice?) for authoring; 
     maybe commercial, like OverLeaf for LaTeX, given its current popularity, at
     least until something eclipses it, preferably open-source.)
   
## Research about library services (and infrastructure to support it)

  - data and API availability
    - to what degree do vendors make APIs open to libraries?
    - to what degree does the library make APIs or other data access open to
      researchers or the academic community?
    - can these be expanded?
  - cross database search
    - existing services?
    - commercial or open?
    - keyword and classification standards
  - Search / discovery applications
    - virtual shelf browsing and navigation of possible arrangements
    - my research: navigation of multiple, overlapping controlled medical
      terminologies to support query, analysis, and distributed, replicable
      research with patient data repositories. highly specialized with
      few analogs understandable to a broader population. but the problem
      in library search is closely related, since library systems also
      rely on overlapping classification standards.

## Collaboration with iSchool

 - how can the library be a "lab" for LIS, IS, HCI, etc. research?
 - UMD iSchool among the best for info/tech ethics, accessibility, and HCI
