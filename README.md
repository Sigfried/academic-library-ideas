Ideas for services and projects for the library of a large research university (because I'm on the student advisory board)

[View as webpage](http://sigfried.github.io/academic-library-ideas)


## Collaboration with iSchool

 - how can the library be a "lab" for LIS, IS, HCI, etc. research?
 
## Search / discovery applications

 - my research
 - classification standards, keywords

## Research services

 - better support for citation management software
 - support for open-source research authoring workflows
 - support for open-science, FAIR data management, curation, publishing
 - training and individual support should go beyond beginner-level use
   of tools
   - library should choose specific tools it recommends (preferably open-source;
     probably Zotero for citation mgt; LaTeX (and OpenOffice?) for authoring; 
     maybe commercial, like OverLeaf for LaTeX, given its current popularity, at
     least until something eclipses it, preferably open-source.)
